                    <h2>RIGHT FORMS OF VERB</h2>
                    <p><strong>Verbs</strong> change form depending on tense, aspect, mood, or voice. There are three main forms of a verb: <strong>Base Form</strong>, <strong>Past Form</strong>, and <strong>Past Participle</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Base Form</strong> (also called the infinitive) is the verb in its basic form without any endings.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>play, read, write</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Past Form</strong> indicates an action that has already happened or is completed.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>played, read, wrote</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Past Participle</strong> is used in perfect tenses and passive voice.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>played, read, written</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Regular Verbs:</strong> These verbs follow a consistent pattern in their past and past participle forms by adding <em>-ed</em> to the base form.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>talk → talked, walk → walked</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Irregular Verbs:</strong> These verbs do not follow the regular pattern and have unique past and past participle forms.</p>
                    <p>Example: <em>go → went → gone, eat → ate → eaten</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Use of Right Forms in Tenses:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Present Tense:</strong> Use the base form or adds <em>-s</em> for third-person singular.<br>Example: "I play," "He plays"</li>
                        <li><strong>Past Tense:</strong> Use the past form.<br>Example: "I played," "She watched"</li>
                        <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Use the past participle with "have" or "has."<br>Example: "I have played," "She has seen"</li>
                        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Use the past participle with "had."<br>Example: "They had finished," "She had written"</li>

                    <p><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The subject of the sentence performs the action.<br>Example: "The dog bit the man."</p>
                    <p><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The subject of the sentence receives the action.<br>Example: "The man was bitten by the dog."</p>

                        <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were happening at a specific time in the past.<br>Example: "I was playing soccer at 3 PM."</li>
                        <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that were completed before another action in the past.<br>Example: "I had played soccer before it started raining."</li>
                        <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous:</strong> Describes actions that were ongoing until another action in the past.<br>Example: "I had been playing soccer for two hours when it started raining."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Future Tense</h3>
                    <p>The future tense describes actions that will happen.</p>

                        <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Describes actions that will be completed before a specific time in the future.<br>Example: "I will have played soccer by 6 PM tomorrow."</li>
